steps:
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented."
    - copy: "After selecting 'Pie chart' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what labels, values, and style attributes were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."

    - copy: "You can also use the data featured in this tutorial by clicking on 'Open This Data in Plotly' on the left-hand side. It'll open in your workspace."

   sub-steps:

For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/create-pie-chart/new colours.png)"
    - copy: "You can also take your pie chart to the next level by pulling apart your pie slices, or by creating a donut chart."
    - copy: "You'll be able to do both by visiting 'Traces' in the STYLE section. For pulling your pie slices apart, play with the percentage in the PULL APART % field under 'Modify'."
      img: "![Pull apart](../static/images/create-pie-chart/new pull apart.png)"
    - copy: "If you wish to create a donut chart, you can play around with the % in the HOLE field."
