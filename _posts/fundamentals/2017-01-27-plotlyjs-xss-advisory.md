## Summary of issue

A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been fixed in the plotly.js library.

An attacker can trick an unsuspecting user into viewing a specially crafted plot, then moving the mouse over a certain
part of the plot, on a site that uses plotly.js (including the cloud version
of [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly)).  The vulnerability would have allowed the attacker to perform any action using the victim's
credentials on that site.
