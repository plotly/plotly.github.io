steps:
 - title: Introduction
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Make branding consistency much easier by creating a custom theme that you can share with your team, or use one of Plotly's six pre-built themes. Theming can save you time, and makes it much easier to re-use your favorite defaults."

 - title: Create a Theme
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After you've plotted, styled and saved your graph, click on the 'Create' under the 'Theme' button on the left-hand side of chart studio. Next, click on the 'Enable' button to make a theme from your current plot style."

    - copy: "A theme is a set of formatting choices including graph background, colors, fonts, axes settings, margins, and legend (if you choose to have one in your plot). The 'Style' menu displays all these options to modify characteristics of the overall chart layout."

 - title: Apply a Theme 
   sub-steps:
     - copy: "You might find theme very handy to use for keeping consistency of graphs/reports among different teams in your company. You either can use the built-in theme by clicking on the 'Built-in' button, or use your own theme by clicking on the 'Personal' button, which shows all the themes you've made."

 - title: Theme vs. Template
   sub-steps:
     - copy: "The template is more related to data structure (e.g., the same trace(s) will be plotted each time), while theme is more about the style attributes. Basically, templates are the foundation of your work, that means you start with the ['pre-made templates'](https://help.plot.ly/add-a-template-in-chart-studio/), then add your own data and style it as you wish. While, for using theme you need to add a trace first, then you can apply a theme on your graph, and modify it if you wish so. You can add collaborators and give them 'Read & Write' or 'Read-only' permission. See ['add collaborators'](https://help.plot.ly/collaborate-in-plotly) for more information."
