 - title: Apply a Theme 
     - copy: "You might find theme very handy to use for keeping consistency of graphs/reports among different teams in your company. You either can use the built-in theme by clicking on the 'Built-in' button, or use your own theme by clicking on the 'Personal' button, which shows all the themes you've made."

 - title: Theme vs. Template
   sub-steps:
     - copy: "Templates are the foundation of your work, that means you start with the pre-made templates, then add your own data and style it as you wish. While, you can apply a theme either after creating your graph from scratch, or from the beginning. You can add collaborators and give them 'Read & Write' or 'Read-only' permission. See ['add collaborators'](https://help.plot.ly/collaborate-in-plotly) for more information."
