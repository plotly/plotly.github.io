Follow along below to make a histogram of your own. If you’re unfamiliar with histograms, check out this article: [https://plot.ly/histogram/](http://help.plot.ly/histograms/)

### Step 1: Set up the grid

This is one way you could set up Chart Studio’s grid to make the graph above.  Copy the data here: [https://plot.ly/~cimar/127](https://plot.ly/~cimar/127) | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image01.png)
Select “Histogram” from the MAKE A PLOT menu. | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image18.png)
Select only one column of data for a basic histogram (two with the ‘group by’ option)… | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image05.png)
&#8230;These values will appear on our x-axis.  The heights of the bars of our histogram will denote how many times each value or “bin” of values appears in the column. To learn more see: [https://help.plot.ly/histogram/](/histogram/) | ![How to Make a Histogram Online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image15.gif)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid see: [https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/](https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid)) | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image21.png)

### Step 2: Drawing the curve

Your plot should look something like this.  Open the FIT DATA popover in the toolbar. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image20.png) ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image27.png)
Click through to add a fit to the “Height” trace. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image26.png)

### Step 3: Style and annotate

Your plot should now look something like this. In order to get the graph at the top of the chart, you’ll need to style and annotate it.Open the NOTES popover. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image03.png) ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image22.png)
This is what the NOTES popover looks like. The “+” sign adds new notes. Hide the arrow. Set the “Move with” option to “Data”, as the note refers to a specific pair of points on the plot. | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image24.png)
Find the note on the plot, and drag it to where you want it. Click the note to edit its text. Use markup to style and format it. | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image17.png)  &lt;b&gt;MEAN: 72.8&#8243;&lt;br&gt;MEDIAN:73&#8243;&lt;/b&gt;
Click the plot title and axis titles to edit their text. Use markup to link to your source. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image00.png) &lt;b&gt;HEIGHT (INCHES)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#8221;http://theleafsnation.com/2014/5/25/justin-s-nhl-draftbook-2013-1963&#8243;&gt;NHL Draftbook, Justin Fisher&lt;/a&gt;
This is what the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover looks like for the “Height” trace. We’ve changed the bar color and made them narrower. | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image13.png) ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image26.png)
This is what the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover looks like for the “Height &#8211; fit” trace. We’ve changed the line color and stroke. | ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image07.png)
This is what the “General” and “Margins” tabs of the LAYOUT popover should look like. We’re giving our plot a grey background, and we’ve changed some of the font options. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image23.png) ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image02.png)
This is what the “Lines” tab of the AXES popover looks like. We’re hiding the body grid lines, and colored the zero line red. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image19.png)
We’re removing the legend from the sidebar in the LEGEND popover. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image12.png)
Your finished chart should look something like this. |  ![How to make a histogram online](/static/images/make-a-histogram/image08.png)
