   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Plotly dashboards are now more interactive and stylish than ever."
    - copy: "Not only can you add a [plot](http://help.plot.ly/create-a-dashboard/#step-3-add-a-plot), and [text] (http://help.plot.ly/create-a-dashboard/#step-7-add-text) to your dashboard, you can add a webpage too."

 - title: Webpage Examples
   sub-steps:  
    - copy: "Privacy and security is important at Plotly, and our security measures may only allow certain webpages to work on the dashboards."
    - copy: "In order to add a webpage to your dashboard, it's important to keep in mind that the page you wish to add to your dashboard may not work. Not all websites allow embedding, and some webpages may be blocked for security reasons. That being said, you can still add cool pages to the dashboard, you just need to try and see if they'll work. We'll show you a few example below."
    - copy: "Some of the pages that can be added to your dashboard include videos, maps, feeds, and content from your personal or business website."
    - copy: "For this tutorial, we'll add a map and a video. Let's begin!"
    
 - title: Add a Map
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "We'll start with a Google map, and we find the embed code by clicking on the menu tab on the left-hand side of the Google Maps page."

    - copy: "As you can see in the animated image below, we copy and paste the Google link into the URL field, but use only the URL part of the embed code. Click 'Save'."

 - title: Add a Video
   sub-steps:      
    - copy: "Websites like Vimeo and Youtube have an embed option for their videos. While you *can* add a Vimeo video to our dashboard, videos from Youtube don't work at the moment."
    - copy: "Once we've located the embed code on the Vimeo website, we'll add the actual URL of the video instead of the entire snippet."
      img: "![Vimeo embed code](../static/images/dashboards/vimeo embed code.png)"
    - copy: "We'll enter this link in the URL field."

      img: "![Dashboard video](../static/images/dashboards/dashboard video.png)"
    - copy: "Our dashboard is looking pretty cool. You can [style](http://help.plot.ly/create-a-dashboard/#step-6-style-your-dashboard) your dashboard and [resize and rearrange](http://help.plot.ly/create-a-dashboard/#step-5-size-and-arrange-the-plots) the items once again before you [save](http://help.plot.ly/create-a-dashboard/#step-9-save-and-share-a-dashboard)."
