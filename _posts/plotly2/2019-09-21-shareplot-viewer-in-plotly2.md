steps:
 - title: Introduction
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Plotly dashboards are a stunning way to display your graphs. Your charts are fully interactive with publication-quality graphics, and there's nothing to download or install â€” it's 100% web-based."
    - copy: "Our dashboards are used by companies such as Netflix, Tesla, and Google for their customization options and features. If you too want to present your plots in a cool way, keep reading."

 - title: Create a Dashboard
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "The first step is to go to the [Plotly dashboards](https://plot.ly/dashboard/create/) page and bookmark it."
    - copy: "The image below is what an empty dashboard looks like. As you can see, you have a few options of what to add, including a plot, text or a webpage."

 - title: Add a Plot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "To add a chart to your dashboard click on 'Plot'."
      img: "![Add plot](../static/images/dashboards/add plot window.png)"
    - copy: "Another window will be displayed, and you'll have the option of adding it by entering the URL of the plot, or uploading it from your list of files."
      img: "![Add plot window](../static/images/dashboards/add plot window.png)"
    - copy: "If you choose 'URL', it's the Shareable Link that's provided when you [share](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/#step-5-share-your-plot) your plot."
      img: "![Add URL](..static/images/dashboards/add url.png/)"
    - copy: "Clicking on 'Your Files' will open a popup that will display your saved plots. These are plots that are in your [Organize](https://plot.ly/organize/) or in your Profile page (you can get there by typing this URL:'http://plot.ly/~YOURUSERNAME' into your address bar)."
      img: "![Your files](../static/images/dashboards/Your Files.png)"      
    - copy: "However you add your first plot, it'll be displayed at the center. You can either add another plot, or start styling your dashboard right away."
      img: "![Plot added](../static/images/dashboards/first plot.png)"

 - title: Add a Second Plot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "To add a second plot, we'll click on the 'Plot' button as the bottom left side of the page."
      img: "![Add second plot](../static/images/dashboards/second plot.png)"
    - copy: "It'll open another 'Add a Plot' window below your first chart, so you may have to scroll down to view it. Note that we've zoomed out for the purpose of this tutorial."
      img: "![Add plot](../static/images/dashboards/second plot added.png)"
    - copy: "Once you've added your second plot, either by URL or through Your Files, it'll be displayed in the same spot below your first plot. Don't want it to appear there? NO problem. We'll re-position it by dragging it over so it's next to the first."
      img: "![Drag second plot](../static/images/dashboards/drag plot.gif)"
    - copy: "It's absolutely possible to add a third plot, so we'll go ahead and do that."

    - copy: "Once you've finished adding all the plots you need for your dashboard, feel free to re-position them again."
      img: "![Reposition plots](../static/images/dashboards/repositioning all.gif)"  
    - copy: "If you need to replace the plot for another, you can hit the 'Edit' button and you'll be shown the same 'Add a Plot' modal window as when we first started."

      img: "![Settings panel](../static/images/dashboards/dashboard settings panel.png)"
    - copy: "Type your title directly in the field under 'Title'. As you type, you'll notice it being added to the dashboard header bar."
      img: "![Dashboard title](../static/images/dashboards/Add dashboard title.gif)"
    - copy: "You can add a logo by adding the URL of where the image is being hosted and it'll appear next to your dashboard title."
      img: "![Add logo](../static/images/dashboards/logo.png)"
    - copy: "There's also an option of adding a subtitle and a URL linked to it. Once the plot is saved, whoever is viewing this dashboard can click on the subtitle and they'll be redirected to the URL."

    - copy: "The Settings panel is where you can change the color of your dashboard, including the header bar and box borders. "
